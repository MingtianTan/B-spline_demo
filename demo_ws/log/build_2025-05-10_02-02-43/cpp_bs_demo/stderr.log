[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcpp_bs_demo_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "cpp_bs_demo_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "cpp_bs_demo_interface" with any of the following names:

    cpp_bs_demo_interfaceConfig.cmake
    cpp_bs_demo_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cpp_bs_demo_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "cpp_bs_demo_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "cpp_bs_demo_interface" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
